### Three seperate applications where created and integrated into one another to create the AI Agent experience. The first is an email app, Email.py that allows users to send emails to a centralized inbox. These emails are then stored in a json format. The second is a calendar app, Calendar.py that allows users to schedule events at different dates. These events and dates are then stored in a separate json file. Both the email and calendar apps have GUIs to all the user to interact with the software. The final and third application is the AI Agent. This uses an LLM to parse resumes, extract values, filter candidates based on conditions, create interview invites that it then sends through the email app, while also parsing replies generated by the user during the pipeline to simulate candidates replying to interview invites to schedule the actual interview if the time and date are not taken and sending a follow up email with a new date and time if it is taken.
